<br/>

Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States, serving from 1861 to 1865. He is best known for leading the nation through the Civil War and working to end slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation and the passage of the 13th Amendment. Lincolnâ€™s leadership preserved the Union, and his famous Gettysburg Address redefined the principles of equality and democracy. Tragically, he was assassinated in April 1865, but his legacy endures as one of America's greatest presidents.
