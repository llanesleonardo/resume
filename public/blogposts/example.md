# What is HTML?
<br/>
HTML, or **HyperText Markup Language**, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. HTML acts as the backbone of all websites, defining the structure and layout of web pages.
<br/>

## How HTML Works
<br/>
HTML uses "tags" to instruct the browser on how to display different elements of the webpage. Each element in HTML is surrounded by opening and closing tags, and these tags specify the purpose and function of that element.
<br/>

### Basic Structure of an HTML Document
<br/>
A typical HTML document contains the following structure:
<br/>

```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document structure.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
```
